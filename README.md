# NoteAnt Project Repo

## Project Overview

We all take notes at some point, either in class or in a meeting. One of the popular methods of note-taking is typing down your thoughts while listening. A lot of times, the notes we took can be hard to read or confusing. To solve this problem, we will build a web application empowered by ChatGPT that helps users to complete and summarize notes.

Behind the scenes is the MERN stack, Pivotal Tracker, Git/GitHub, and many other libraries. The main tech stack and its purpose are:

- **MongoDB**: Store notes documents and user account credentials.
- **ExpressJS**: Build server structure, handle CRUD operations, and RESTful requests.
- **React**: Front-end user interface and data handling.
- **NodeJS**: Provides a runtime environment for our project to operate.
