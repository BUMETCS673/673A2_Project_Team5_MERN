Hi everyone! I'm Wenhao Tian, also go by Chris, 2nd year in MSCS with concentration in DA. I came from a non-CS background. I studied mechanical engineering in UWashington, became interested in programming in my junior year and eventually decided to switch to CS. I have some experience with MERN stack building a website that works similar to hotpads.com that the users can sign up for account, log in/out, make posts, leave comments, etc. I'm communicative and wanting to learn new stuff. CheersÔºÅ
