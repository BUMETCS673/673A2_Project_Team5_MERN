Hello, I'm Guancheng Huang from China. You can also call me Frankie. I'm a first year MSSD student. In the summer semester I took a web application course and learnt html, css, javascript and react. In this semester I will also take a server side programming course which focuses on nodejs, php and mongodb. Glad to meet everyone in the class.
